# Le Node Routerboard

This is a trivial app that connect to Routerboard / Mikrotik routers and displays
the RX of the first Interface as a doughnut chart.

## Usage

### Standalone

It is a simple PHP app with some Javascript.
Do not forget to `npm install` and `composer install`!

### With Docker

As simple as `docker-compose up` as soon as you have modified the required variables.
